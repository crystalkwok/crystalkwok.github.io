			<p>The motivation behind Flunkless is this question: how do you effectively engage and motivate participation from over a hundred students in a college lecture?  In large universities, such as UCSD, the current way lectures work is that the communication is only from the professor to the students, but not the other way aroud.  Also, many students are losing interest during lecture and going to their laptops for distractions.  We decided to address this issue by creating a <b>virtual space to ask questions, post comments, and share links DURING LECTURE to enable active participation of multiple students at the same time</b>.</p>

			<p>Our original idea was a way to integrate academics and Facebook together.  We decided to conduct interviews of students, teaching assistants, and professors based on how they use Facebook or other tools (like Piazza and Blackboard) for academics.</p>
			<p>After 12 interviews, we consolidated our user data into an affinity diagram, which is a way to visualize the patterns of the different issues and insights presented by our users that easily reveals our users' needs.</p>

			<p>We decided to continue with user research and conducted 6 more interviews with our new wireframes and paper prototypes to test if it fit the users' needs and passed usability tests.

However, when we posed the question if we were to offer synchronous communication during lecture, users seemed to really like this new idea.  Originally, we thought the problem was finding a more effective way for nonsynchronous communication, but user data has shown us that the user need is for <b>synchronous communication during lecture</b>, which is impossible in a large lecture without technology.  This is reflective of a paper written by a prominent HCI professor, Professor Jim Hollan, who mentions that technology's purpose shound not be to replicate face-to-face interaction, but to go <i>beyond being there</i> and to meet needs that are not met even with physical proximity.</p>
