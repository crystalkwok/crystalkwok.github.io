            <br>
            <p>Students often struggle with being able to manage all different aspects of their time, while remembering all the different events and when to start studying for exams.  When will a full-time student find the time to fulfill their dream of becoming a doctor by applying to medical school while frantically trying to maintain their grades and being president?  Students also often struggle with wasting their free time on Facebook, thinking there is nothing they need to work on at that time, and thinking they have more time than they actually do (hence the massive amounts of cramming and procrastination).  This is usually because students often lack the motivation to keep working hard in their studies, because they cannot see or even remember their end goal.  
                
                <br><br>Thus, our question is this: how can a calendar / planner help students be effective with their time?  Studies have shown that people need to believe in what they do, which is why we have chosen to make CROWN an interactive goal-based web calendar, where users can set their long-term and short-term goals.  <!--Crown is an interactive web-based calendar and planner where students can manage their time better, plan out when to work on their long-term and short-term goals, and plan when to start studying for exams and when to start assignments.  Another feature we have added is our timeline, where users can view the events in their calendar in a different way that will better show priority and importance in events, which can help students make better decisions on what to work on during their free time.-->  Our motivation for CROWN is for students to <b>effectively maximize their time to fulfill their goals</b>, and essentially to <b>make the important urgent</b>.</p>

                    <p class="fullside">CROWN offers the timeline view for each student's personal calendar, which is a new way to visually interpret time.  We noticed that the traditional calendar view does not differentiate between important (exams and weddings) and less important events (repeating classes).  However, important events should be given more attention and time and are often more urgent, but the traditional calendar view does not offer a way to visually interpret what is most urgent.  Therefore, the different events on the timeline are created to be different sizes based on the importance.  Also, the timeline offers a new way to see how close or far apart important events are, indicating whether or not the student needs to make a decision in light of knowing how many important events are approaching.  For example, if a student saw that they had two exams and a wedding that were close together in the timeline, which means that there is little time in between each event, the student may decide to start studying for their exams earlier because they know they won't have time later with all their important events occurring.  
                        <br><br>The total number of priorities offered is 3.  The first and lowest priority, indicated by a small square on the timeline, is for less important and repeating events.  The second priority, indicated by the medium square, is for events that are slightly more important, such as small assignments due or events with friends.  The third priority, indicated by the largest square, is for events that are extremely important that need attention, demand urgency, and demand a change in action.  For example, if a student saw that a final, with the highest priority and is the first thing that pops out in the timeline view, was coming up soon, they would probably start studying for their final.
                    <br><br>
                    For our timeline view, CROWN offers a daily, weekly, and monthly view.  In the daily view, all three kinds of priorities will be shown.  In the weekly view, only the medium and high priority events will be shown, and the time will still remain static.  This is to not only highlight only the important events that need attention, but also to prevent crowding of events.  In the monthly view, only the high priority events will be shown to highlight only the extremely important events in the student's life.
