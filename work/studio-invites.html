                                <p>Bluebeam’s product team recently shifted focus onto better retaining enterprise customers, characterized by:</P>

We conducted qualitative research with about 7 enterprise sized customers, asking them about how they used Studio, what were the most important pain points, the reason behind their pain points or potential solutions, and more.  Most common problems lied in:</P>
                              <ul>

                            <p>We dug into why users mentioned pain points or feature requests, to see if we could solve in various ways with given constraints.  Together with engineering, we knew that for some of the problems, the right way would require massive technical rework, such as a new structure of Studio. We decided as a team to <b>solve problems within “creating a new space,” which did not demand a completely new structure</b>, and would provide value to our customers while we planned out how to provide significant value with technical rework.</p>

                                  During our research, each collaboration space typically has a “<b>moderator</b>”, who manages the people aspect, such as ensuring “<b>participants</b>” join. The previous in-app method only allowed you to put in one email at a time. Our Outlook integration only showed people that were within the company, so inviting external people was still individually typed.
                                  <b>Even though security was a concern, moderators utilized workarounds & outside methods to invite many people with ease & fulfill other needs, but had no secure access</b> because participants would have to join before any action could be taken, like blocking or giving the right permission.

It could also be from multiple sources at a time because different companies send you their own list of people to invite.  Remember, enterprise customers were more likely to work with more external collaborators. </p>

People won’t have to clean up the email list, regardless of what the source includes. No user asked for this, but this understood the user’s context and it became a highlighted delighter. To accommodate similar people always working together and being invited, we also made our Groups feature more <b>discoverable</b> that many didn’t know about. This makes it easier to handle the constant churn of new internal people coming into a project that often happens with Enterprise companies.</p>

                                  Since there were often multiple sources / lists from multiple external collaborators, moderators who often invited external people loved the domain separation because domains are an indicator of companies, so they could double-check easily if all the people that need to be involved were invited. For example, they’ll need to invite 4 subcontractors, but they’ll forget to include the electrical team since they sent over a separate list.

However, if they are <b>unaware of where to review work, the deadlines will be missed</b> and projects will be delayed, <b>costing more money</b>, since they cannot move forward until reviewed.
                                  <b>Participation, which is legally required, is slower or even missed due to lack of visibility for moderators and invites being missed for participants, which pushes back deadlines.</b>

                                    We’re still waiting to hear back about participation rates and people using the in-app invite process more. We received great feedback from our users, including an awesome review <a href="https://captainbimcad.com/new-blog/2020/8/19/reviewing-revu-20" target="_blank">here</a> (website has expired, but mentioned <b>how the improved Inviting experience really listened & focused on user feedback</b>). From Beta, the ease of use was rated <b>4.3/5</b>. Here are some quotes:

                                    This project isn’t full of new, innovative interactions and can almost seem quite obvious, especially at first. However, it was a practice in identifying valuable ways to improve experiences that solves pain points and meet business goals that users won’t mention because they are so familiar with their current process.

                                    Future initiatives with this team continued to <b>improve ease of use for security</b>, especially for Enterprise customers.  One of the reasons why people wanted to edit other’s markups / notes was because people would leave the company (higher company turnover within Enterprise companies), but no one else could edit their work. This would be detrimental if they wrote something incorrect that was shown to other external teams, or clients & owners of the projects. To provide value within our technical constraint (only one person can edit their assigned markup), we allowed <b>moderators to deny people and reassign their markups</b> / notes to one other person already on the Studio space to edit and manage. Studio invites was the base that makes the security & management aspect possible, so the people management aspect can start right away without having to wait for someone to join, so only the right people can have the right access.
