                          <p>As a new team together, we wanted to start afresh and hear the most important pain points from our beloved customers.  We conducted qualitative research with about 7 enterprise sized customers, asking them about how they used Studio, what were some pain points, the reason behind their pain points or potential solutions, and how solving it would affect them.  Most common problems lied in:</P>

                            <p>We spent a lot of time really digging into why users mentioned pain points or feature requests, to see if we could solve those problems in other ways.  Together with engineering, we knew that for some of the problems, to solve it the right way would require massive technical rework, enough to warrant a completely new structure of Studio. We decided as a team to <b>solve problems within “creating a new space,” which did not demand a completely new structure</b>, and would provide value to our customers at our next release while we planned out how to provide significant value with huge technical rework.</p>

                                  During our research, each collaboration space typically has a “<b>moderator</b>”, who manages the people aspect, such as ensuring “<b>participants</b>” join.

It could also be from multiple sources at a time because different companies send you their own list of people to invite.  Remember, enterprise customers were more likely to work with more external collaborators. </p>

People won’t have to clean up the email list, regardless of what the source includes. No user asked for this, but this understood the user’s context and it became a highlighted delighter. To accommodate similar people always working together and being invited, we also made our Groups feature more <b>discoverable</b> that many didn’t know about.

                                  Since there were often multiple sources / lists from multiple external collaborators, moderators who often invited external people loved the domain separation because domains are an indicator of companies, so they could double-check easily if all the people that need to be involved were invited. For example, they’ll need to invite 4 subcontractors, but they’ll forget to include the electrical team since they sent over a separate list.

                                    We’re still waiting to hear back about participation rates and people using the in-app invite process more. We received great feedback from our users, including an awesome review here (website has expired, but mentioned <b>how the improved Inviting experience really listened & focused on user feedback</b>). From Beta, the ease of use was rated <b>4.3/5</b>. Here are some quotes:

                                    This project isn’t full of new, innovative interactions and can almost seem quite obvious, especially at first. However, it was a practice in identifying valuable ways to improve experiences and meet business goals that users won’t mention because they are so familiar with their current process.

                                    Future initiatives with this team continued to <b>improve ease of use for security</b>, especially for Enterprise customers.  One of the reasons why people wanted to edit other’s markups / notes was because people would leave the company (higher company turnover within Enterprise companies), but no one else could edit their work. This would be detrimental if they wrote something incorrect that was shown to other external teams, or clients & owners of the projects. To provide value within our technical constraint (only one person can edit their assigned markup), we allowed <b>moderators to deny people and reassign their markups</b> / notes to one other person already on the Studio space to edit and manage. Studio invites was the base that makes the security & management aspect possible, so only the right people can access the space without waiting for either people to open the external invite before it could happen.
