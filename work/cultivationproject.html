The Cultivation Project hopes to connect supporters to missionaries in an easier way, and to encourage more prayer as the main avenue to support missionaries.

                        <p class="step_description">This project is still in it's beginning stages of completing its MVP, but I believe this will solve some pain points supporters and missionaries have been experiencing. The Cultivation Project had a booth at Chinese Missions Conference (CMC) and had great feedback from people there.

                                    <p class="step_description">Everyone placed a lot of emphasis on wanting to follow the journey the missionary was on-- spiritually, emotionally, and physically.  Supporters wanted to know the personal thoughts of the missionary, what the missionary had learned from their trip, and even follow the missionary to the different places.  Missionaries spent a lot of their posts sharing their thoughts and feelings throughout the trip.  However, we discussed that even though that was what users cared about, we also wanted to the main focus of the users to be on the people that were being served, not the missionary.

                                    <p class="step_description">Supporters usually had a certain group of people they had a heart for, and it was usually a group of people with a certain culture-- Japanese, Chinese, etc.  Supporters were more likely to venture out to find missionaries if they served the particular people group they were searching for, and were long term.  Missionaries also wanted to connect with others serving in the same area so they could provide support for one another as well.  Also, when naming their trips, missionaries always included something about the location in the name.

                                    <p class="step_description">A lot of short termers resorted to using Facebook or email to invite people to support them-- usually extended to friends, and maybe acquintances.  Not all felt comfortable sharing it on Facebook.  This was sometimes due to sensitivity of the trip, or just keeping it to people who would knew them and wouldn't misinterpret their intentions for going on the trip.  
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="step_description">Supporters often mentioned while they had tried to follow some of their friends and missionaries, they often forgot the context.  They may have missed a few posts along the way, or the initial support letter was sent so long ago that they forgot what this team was doing on this trip.  They also were unsure how many posts they missed along the way-- was this the most updated post? They also sometimes got notifications about posts at the most inconvenient times, and often forgot to return to read the post or pray for the missionary.

                                    <p class="step_description">Supporters were more willing to venture out to find missionaries they did not know to support if they could find a connection with them.  Currently, they mostly heard about them from church, like if the church supported them.  They were also more willing if the missionary's activity was something they were interested in for the future, or something they were currently doing.

                                    <p class="step_description">Missionaries in closed countries are the people with the biggest trouble updating their supporters on prayer requests.  They have to be extremely careful with what they type, careful not to type in keywords, and careful not to divulge too much of where they are.  They have resorted to replacing keywords and places with just letters, or another similar action like "rapping" for prayer.

I would have loved to do more wireframing, but we didn't have enough time.  Ultimately, due to the time constraint, designs and user flows were constantly changed from lack of knowing what was coming next, or just more thought was put into the design.</p>

                            <p class="step_description">For the designs, I would have loved to focus more on the journey of the missionary, which also encouraging users to focus on the people being served.  For the journey, I wanted an easy way to click through the posts on the side, as well as a read/unread feature for supporters in case they missed some in the middle. We think that security will be the main value when that is added onto the product-- that is the main need no other platform has been able to fulfill.</p>
