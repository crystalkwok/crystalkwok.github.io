Their hesitancy was two things; first, that an algorithm could not account for the needed flexibility they, our customers, and retailers needed to make necessary preferences work.  With Excel, they could make any and all changes needed.  However, the cost of the flexibility was data inaccuracy, because moving data around often caused numbers that shouldn't be touched to be changed, and for data to be lost in the transfer.</P>
                          <p class="inner-section">Second, they often had fears and asked <i>would this replace my job?</i>  We acknowledged that fear, but we assured them that their value was not in manipulating Excel cells, but rather their logistics knowledge essential for the high margin program to work in reality with real trucks & products.</p>
                          <p class="inner-section">To mitigate and encourage adoption, we worked closely with the team to understand what they needed, what knowledge they wanted to apply themselves, and how we could prevent data inaccuracies.</p>

                                    Some trucks can fit more volume than the data calculates because you could fit some products in tiny spaces. The team risks it and overestimates trucks from their knowledge of customers’ patterns to potentially save money. Tribal knowledge, or learned experience, creates a need for flexibility past what our algorithm can predict through the data. Even though they built trucks themselves previously, they still always reviewed what they had built to improve it.  <b>However, previous attempts in Excel to apply “tribal knowledge” cause data corruption, and is time-consuming to figure out and move data around in different trucks.</b> You can imagine their horror when they lost many orders’ data in their clipboard and had to find it again, or when the data columns didn’t match in sheet being copied to.

                                <p class="inner-section">From our testing, our current solution has saved 3 hours per week for 5 people each. That’s 15 hours every week! That also doesn’t include the amount of time saved not manually building trucks as they expand to other retailers, such as Target. This also saves more time through less emails and corrections due to increased data accuracy.</p>
                                <p>We assured the team throughout the process that the company valued their logistics knowledge, not their keyboard shortcuts on Excel.  The team, although not initially open, saw the value of good, clear, easy-to-use design, only achievable by consistent research with them for their expertise.  We did not simply create a purely engineering-led product by releasing an algorithm and claiming it was better. Because it was user-led, fulfilled their needs, and solved pain points, and we constantly looked to them for feedback, they fully adopted this product to use every week to save them money and time in order to expand the business.  Mentioned in Tracking Loads, success in consolidation’s ability to ship on time than when shipping their individual orders encourages other retailers to want to refer us to their other supplies (ex: Popchips or Neutrogena) based on our successes, therefore <b>increasing revenue</b>.</p>
