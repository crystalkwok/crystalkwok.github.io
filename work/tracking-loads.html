                                <p>To ship our customer’s orders, CaseStack coordinates with carriers and warehouses to ensure truckloads (shortened to loads) make it to the retailers, such as Walmart. However, carriers are finicky — they’ll say they’re coming, yet push back their estimated time of arrival (ETA). Set appointment times are missed from miscommunication, or they’ll drop.</P>

                            </div>

                            <div class="inner-section row">

                            </div>

                            <p>Currently, Casestack employs Google Sheets to communicate with multiple parties if/when a carrier will arrive at the warehouse. However, because of the information clutter in the current system, keeping up with carrier updates while shipping to more retailers has been difficult. Therefore, CaseStack hasn’t recovered as fast to ship more loads on time even with carrier changes. Less on-time loads mean fines for us, and not delivering on our promise of reliability.
                            </P>

                            <blockquote>
                              How can we deliver more loads on time to ensure reliability and no fines by tracking loads better to combat finicky carriers & drivers?

                        </div>
                          <p class="inner-section">Casestack wanted to scale and increase this business because shipping full truckloads to retailers has given this company its highest margins. However, meeting retailer demands for shipping on time was becoming increasingly important as we shipped more loads, as this was one of the metrics retailers used to determine if they wanted to continue doing business with this supplier (ex: Popchips or Dove).</P>
                          <p class="inner-section">Experiences with the Google Sheet showed that keeping track of so many loads was unscalable, and they needed a new solution. The business success metric was to <b>increase on-time percentage from 80% to 96%</b>. Not only does this help avoid late fees, it could improve relationships with retailers, who would refer our services to suppliers struggling to ship on time. This would therefore <span class="important_underline">increase our revenue</span>.</p>
                          <p class="inner-section">Due to the lack of data we could accurately gather for increasing efficiency and time saved on the Google Sheets, we decided a simple product success metric would be <b>less loads pushed out to the next day</b>. The goal was to make sure all loads to shipping today left by today so that it would more likely be on time.  If they knew about potential delays faster, parties could react more quickly to find new carriers and change schedules to ensure shipping on the same day, therefore making it to the destination on time.</p>

                                        As we learned, load status was key to understanding what was priority.  However, copious colors were added subjectively by individual users to highlight importance, making understanding where each load was difficult. While colors do indicate different things, the abundant amount resulted in a lack of focus. On top of that, they wasted time scanning and looking at every single line on multiple pages because they had to do a time comparison. If the current time had passed any of the key 3 times on any load, it would become higher priority.  Due to the colors, lack of standardization, and the time-wasting action of scanning every load for a time comparison, <b>they couldn’t easily tell which ones took priority to start resolving issues for</b>.

                                <p class="inner-section">The system for comments is that a single column was assigned to a group, so each would archive previous comments and reuse the same cell. This method helped easily identify the party and who to contact. However, there was no chronological order for the comments, even though the most recent comment is most valued, regardless of who wrote it.</p>
                                <b class="inner-section">Due to Google Sheets’ limitations, following the chronological conversation to know next steps was difficult, and comments were often deleted.</b>
                                <p class="inner-section">Old comments were deleted to indicate “no issues to address”, but historical data was lost. Some people accidentally wrote over comments so context was lost. Cells grew as the comments got longer, making it hard to scan each vertical line.</p>

                                <p>Based on the research, comments needed to include:</p>
                                <ul class="inner-section">
                                  <li>show commented user group</li>
                                  <li>order comments in chronological order, regardless of user</li>
                                  <li>make issues resolved disappear visually, but keep for history for easy issue tracking</li>
                                </ul>

                                  Ordering the comments temporally, while clearly indicating the party, make the comments much easier to follow. We learned the presence of comments indicates issues were currently happening with that load. Allowing them to “Resolve Issue” by archiving the current comments indicates “no issues” visually on that load while keeping historical data. To reduce visual clutter and keep visual consistency of each load vertically, we only display what’s needed, meaning the most recent and initial comment, until its looked into more.

                                  Unfortunately, I left Casestack prior to learning if the new product helped with improving on-time metrics or if less loads were pushed out to the next day. I hope a better design helped react to issues quicker!
                                  For all products I have designed, I iterated the most for this design. Usability testing kept coming back unsuccessful, especially for visualizing the statuses — we continued relentlessly at new ideas and sessions. I was reminded to not focus on the detailed pixels for each new iteration, but rather showing lo-fi designs to users sooner rather than later. Another takeaway was finding the balance between reducing clutter and presenting visual clarity. Icons without labels didn’t test very well, considering the current Excel and the types of users.
                                  Thank you design team and Alpaca Engineering team for all your feedback, time, and hard work! Nothing is ever accomplished alone :)
