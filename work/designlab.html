This experiment explored how to improve peer feedback in online classes, collaborating with <a href="https://www.peerstudio.org/" target="_blank">PeerStudio</a> at Stanford.  This experiment was mostly headed by Cat and Vineet, while Rachel and I created artifacts, helped with experimental design, data code (qualitative), read and found papers, helped with creating interfaces for their experiments, and presented at the <i>UCSD Computer Science &amp; Engineering 2015 Undergraduate Poster Session</i>.

                                <p class="step_description">So far, MOOCs (massive online open classes) have shown to be a solution to make education more accessible. <a href="../images/designlab/mooc_implications.pdf" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="http://raycomgroup.worldnow.com/story/25244434/a-1000-mba-moocs-making-education-more-accessible" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2009/04/02/online-education-offers-access-and-affordability" target="_blank">[3]</a> While there are still many issues with MOOCs, including a low retention rate, another problem is the lack of quality in the peer feedback provided in those classes.  Peer feedback is needed of MOOCs, because there are too many students to a single teacher.  However, peer reviews without much instruction lead to grader inaccuracy, inconsistency, and even the perception is that peer feedback in general is unreliable.  The quality of feedback is low compared to a teacher’s or expert's reviews <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/problems-with-online-classes-1098085" target="_blank">[1]</a> . With peer feedback, the quality of education in MOOCs drops <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/moocs-failure-solutions" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p>

Although this is what usability testing is based on, one particular way they differ is that this formally chooses a single hypothesis to test and is subject to critiques after being published.  The experiments with a non-successful hypothesis are still considered important, and need to be documented, which is usually unlike usability testing for products.

                            <p class="subtitle_description">More Questions -- What Else?</p>
                            <p class="step_description">I think this experiment was greatly thought out and methodical.  However, since peer feedback and figuring out the quality is so qualitative, I also have more questions.  Of course training would make an impact, but what else could it be?  Was it really the training, or just the sheer amount of information we passed along?  Or even how long the reviewer was in the experiment-- if they were in the experiment longer, it could make the user believe that they should try harder on their peer feedback, increasing the quality. What if we gave bad training? Would the feedback still improve?  If it does, clearly it wasn't the idea of training them that improved peer feedback-- so what could it be? Simply being forced to put more time into it?  I would also separate out the job context with the training into 2 separate experiments, to see what really impacted what.  This topic definitely needs more research, which has also been started by many others, like this <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1680/2904" target="_blank">one</a>.</p>

                            <p class="step_description">This was the first psychology experiment I was really involved in, where I helped do some of the data coding due to their time constraint.  Rachel and I are so grateful to be involved in the process.  It took a lot of hard work from Cat and Vineet before they could even start on the experiment-- researching and reading ahead of time before they could even start tackling the problem.  You must be prepared and methodical about your research ahead of time.  Being a researcher is hard work, and your work is constantly being questioned.</p>
                            <p class="step_description">
                            Even as I demonstrated in the <a href="#improvements">improvements</a> section, people will find reasons to poke holes in your research, unsure of if the research is truly valid.  Your experiment is often tweaked to see if the impact is still there, to gain a better understanding, or to present another reason on why the impact occurred.  Researchers have to be so careful of making claims of causation, when it could have been correlation.  Putting yourself out there with a published paper is risky, but that's why it takes so much hard work during the actual experiment.  I also learned to remember to define and find measurements of success-- this is what truly marks if the impact you desired was made.  This is important to the claim you are making with your experiment.</p>

                            <p class="step_description">This experience was extremely valuable to me, to see how psychological research can be applied in the HCI realm, and also being around so many intelligent and amazing people.  It was a great opportunity to listen to people consider different ideas, share their thoughts, and share research on current topics, especially when there are so many complexities and dimensions to research in HCI.</p>
                            <p class="step_description">
                            On a personal note, I also learned at the Design Lab to take control and initiative of my own growth,learning, and goals.  I can ask for a change in direction if I don't see what I am doing currently fitting my future overall goal, or if I wish to do something different.  The brilliant minds there have also taught me to continually be curious, and to continue to ask questions (and the right ones!)  And ultimately, <b>never being afraid to fail and to get feedback on your work</b>, because although your ego may hurt a bit at first, it will ultimately be beneficial to hear from different people about your work.</p>

                            <p class="subtitle_description">Thank you!</p>
