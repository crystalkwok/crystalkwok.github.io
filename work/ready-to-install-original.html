                            <p class="inner-section">When I first joined the team, the team had already conducted some research, and decided to focus on managing installation tasks, and material deliveries, issues, and documents within it.  We knew that there were no competitors that had great usability for managing materials (ex: shipping steel bars for a structural install on a construction site) for Subcontractors in the field, and based on how people had been managing it, the pain point was that all information was so separate. </P>
                            <p class="inner-section">But what was the point of managing all this?  Management in itself is not a pain point.  The lack of purpose for the product was evident, because <b>no customer had understood and were willing to purchase the product</b>.</P>

I originally was tasked with redesigning details in an installation task, but the initiative lacked a goal.  I organized 6 research sessions to better understand what construction people wanted to understand from an installation task, so I could learn how we could differentiate from competitors and prioritize what information to put first. </p>

                                Melody, our customer success manager took a poll to a construction focused user base (yes, on Instagram), and we found that any problems re: materials had the least visibility and was most desired to know right away of all the constraints.  On top of that, materials has the most complex process to manage with various parties (Procurement, Shop, Field Team, Project Managers) compared to issues and documents.  There was also no great existing competitor management system for materials with installation tasks, while many have tackled the issues / document space.

However, vendors won’t have certain parts available, and lead times (time it takes to make the material) are often not accurate even if ordered on time, so many end up saying “just send me whatever you have,” so they can start on some of the work, even not in the right order, or they’ll pay laborers for not working, or their laborers will leave for other jobs. Therefore, many installation tasks will have some materials ready, but not all. But how do you know which work has its materials ready so it can start, or can’t start and what materials are they waiting on?

Also, materials are more likely to be damaged or stolen as you store them longer.  Therefore, people have typically done <a href="https://blog.cpsgrp.com/nehp/just-in-time-in-construction" target="_blank">“just in time” deliveries</a>, where only a limited amount of materials are delivered for the tasks planned as needed. This eliminates waste, according to lean construction, although it seems like it creates the problem of materials more likely to be missed.

They simply care about getting the materials requested done and shipped out, and not what installation it ties into on the construction site.

                                <p class="inner-section">I created a new concept with the assets above to research with construction people how valuable this might be.  With the previously shown experience, you could easily see how materials being delivered would immediately show which particular part of an installation task was ready to install (while others were not), while the shop in charge of materials could manage it without the task.  I also showed how materials, not deliveries, tied back to the installation.</p>

                                <p class="inner-section">My goal was to understand if there was a significant demand to know what's ready to be installed, and how it compared relative to our current product.  With this problem, the user group that would gain the most value and would want to know this information would be the field team, since there currently are tools for the shop / vendors (Stratus, Vista, etc.), and asking them to switch tools would be a bigger barrier, so we'd likely do an integration with those tools.  Would field people involved with planning and installing find it valuable to know which tasks had all their materials delivered so they could start their work?  </p>

With the new structure &amp; navigation, hopefully it'll be easier to view what's coming in what delivery and mark them delivered.

                                <h4 class="step">Methodology</h4>
                                <p >I created a prototype with the new concept with “realistic data” (as best Melody in customer success and I could), and I inserted the same data into the current product.  I asked our participants to complete 2 scenarios that they typically did on a daily or weekly basis.  Our scenarios were:</p>
                                <ul class="inner-section">
                                  <li>You are planning out work for this upcoming 6 weeks.  Determine what your next steps would be from the information.</li>
                                  <li>You were told in an email that this delivery with 2 materials would actually be coming today.  Mark this delivery as delivered.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I conducted the research study with 6 participants (people involved with planning out the work onsite), where each completed the same tasks in both.  I had half of the participants start with the current product, and the other half start with the new prototype.  At the end, I asked them to rate both with 2 questions:</p>
                                <ul class="inner-section">
                                  <li>Rate on a scale of 1-10 the ease of use in finding the information you are looking for to understand and figure out next steps, with 1 being the least easy to use, and 10 being the most easy to use. </li>
                                  <li>On a scale of 1-10 for both the prototype and the website, how likely are you to start using this to collaborate on tasks, materials, and deliveries?</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="inner-section">This increase, while not hugely significant, is a step in the right direction.  In the previous test, the Likely to Use score was also around 5 (Avg 5.6), so likely a bigger sample size would result in a similar rating for the old product.</p>
                                <p>
                                  While it might not have the be the perfect solution, they certainly found more value in the new concept.  Some of the feedback were:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>While the automated statuses “Not Ready” or “Ready to Install” didn’t matter to them, the information that fed into that status was valuable to them as an overview.  Likely, we would not use these exact statuses and simply tell them the information -- “1 Delivered” or “2/3 Materials Not Delivered.”  I would be curious how it might change if we introduced other Pre-Install items, like Approved Documents.</li>
                                  <li>Seeing the content as the name as opposed to “List” for the Deliveries and Materials was more clear in finding what they need.</li>
                                  <li>People mostly stayed within the schedule-- that might be their preference to stay within one place, without jumping around to see the information.  Users also felt like other modals made them lost if it brought them to another modal, and couldn’t click back to see the previous information.
                                    <br>I would also research if they mostly stayed on the schedule because that's the typical way how they know what tasks will occur (Gantt charts from Microsoft Projects), or if they would benefit from another design, like a list so they can see immediately what needs to be done right after another.</li>

                                </div>

                                <p class="inner-section">I proposed our next steps were to continue researching if it was still valuable to field teams by iterating on the prototype and testing more, and having the Product Managers start market research to be more confident if this product would sell.  </p>
                                <p class="inner-section">If the end product vision is still considered valuable to field teams, I would recommend our next steps be to research with teams who procure what materials are needed for a project, which could be a particular procurement manager or a project engineer.  These people are key in the beginning for the end vision to work-- tying all materials needed to the installation task in the beginning before the work starts. The concern is that it would be too manual and the team would not be motivated to do this detailed work that they don’t do currently.  I would research ways we could shorten or at least keep the same amount of time they spend currently writing out different materials needed with a new process with the tasks.  Some ideas to shorten the amount of time would be material templates for particular tasks (ex: all piping installs needs these 3 materials).   </p>
                                <p>I also wanted create a design with a different design system, and more optimized for mobile and tablet.  I expect some aspects would be used in mobile, such as accessing information in the field as you see an issue, or on the tablet, when they do morning huddles to talk about what they will be working on that day.  Both instances will need the information on materials and tasks.</p>
