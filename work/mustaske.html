                        <p>In large universities, such as UCSD, the communication is one-way from the professor to the students. Many students are losing interest during lecture and going to their laptops for distractions.  Mustaske uses a live chat room to help facilitate in class lectures, where a student can feel safe to ask questions without being judged, and the professor can meet their goals of helping large bodies of students learn.  With Mustaske, we are not trying to replicate physical proximity with technology, but rather facilitate and meet needs not met with even physical proximity, as mentioned in Jim Hollan's <a href="../images/flunkless/beyond_being_there.pdf" target="blank">paper</a>.  
                        </p>

                        <p>This project was a combination between two projects-- Flunkless, which focused on user research, and Mustaske, which focused on development.  I personally chose to develop my design skills through multiple iterations.

                                    <p class="step_description">Everyone had different people they needed to communicate in different ways, but everyone wanted to send out communication as easily as possible, check communication easily, and know what communication to focus on answering.  Students wanted to communicate with their TAs for a quick response, and TAs and professors wanted to mass communicate quickly about changes or important things to remember.  However, communication was failing currently due to clutter, fear of judgment, or lack of in person availablility.

                                    <p class="step_description">Everyone cared about not intermingling their personal life with their academic life.  TAs and professors didn't want to come off as biased, and students didn't want their personal lives to affect their grades.  TAs and professors often resorted to changing their names on Facebook so no student could find them.  Students were also afraid of approaching TAs and professors with questions because of fear of judgment that teachers wouldn't consider them as "smart", so they liked anonymity.

This was shown when they emphasized hating being bombarded with unnecessary emails, or being unable to find the material they were looking for.  TAs mostly faced what they considered as "clutter emails", which were mainly questions that had already been answered during lecture or the syllabus.

                        <p class="subtitle_description">However, their feedback was about our idea and designs showed that it was <span class="emphasis">questionable if users would actually switch over</span> and use our platform as a new LMS.</p>

                        <p class="step_description">During our second round of interviews, people were not completing understanding what the purpose of our platform was for.  They kept suggesting more features, and not really finding much value in what we already had in there.  They questioned why they would need to use it, such as saying "I'm confused.  Do I use this with my other platforms?"  Also, as we found in our initial findings, older people, like professors, were usually unlikely to want to switch over and relearn a new system.</p>

                        <p class="step_description">It became clear that in order to have users switch from their previous options of LMSs, it had to be 10x better, which our product could not be.</p>

However, other parties weren’t listening, such as fear of judgment, or there was too much clutter to focus on the important things.  We also saw that current Learning Management Systems were nonsynchronous communication, where the professor would post things later after the lecture, but there was no current product to facilitate in-lecture communication.</p>

                        <p class="step_description">This product would not replace lectures, but simply facilitate it for better communication between a large group and a single speaker.  This was designed in mind for students, knowing that they liked anonymity from fear of judgment, and teachers, who just wanted to know what the important things to address were.  This highlights Jim Hollan's paper <a href="../images/flunkless/beyond_being_there.pdf" target="blank">"Beyond Being There"</a>, where it states that technology's purpose is to <b>meet needs not even met with physical proximity, rather than trying to replicate it</b>.</p>

                        <p class="step_description">This idea resonated better with users, because it was a simpler, and a completely new idea, which solves some of their pain points.  This definitely resonates with our initial research findings about Communication, Privacy, and Finding.</p>

                                <p class="step_description">I wanted to focus on the idea of "facilitating in class lectures" only, to focus the product. Therefore, I decided that we needed to highlight the questions.  The most important are the top questions asked, so professors can see what students really want to know.  Students were also interested in the top questions, so they could anticipate if their questions might be answered.  Next was an easy way for people to see questions coming in and out, so students could vote on what they are interested in knowing.</p>
                                <p class="subsection subtitle_list">all else is used sparsely and should not clutter our focus</p>
                                <p class="step_description">I stripped out the class selection from the previous design, since your main focus during a lecture is not switching to another class, but the questions being presented.  While checkpoints were important, they weren't what professors and students were focusing on 100% of the time. Also, during our research, we noticed checkpoints were commonly used in small spurts, but was not referred to commonly throughout the lecture.</p>

I would have preferred students had accounts, where they could easily join existing rooms for their classes.  However, I thought the IDs were a good choice, considering our constraint.</p>
                            <p class="step_description col-md-9 col-sm-9 col-xs-12">I also wish I had more time to do more research before redesigning this product.  I have so many more questions I would have asked to see what users really cared about, and how they might differ based on their role.  I also really wonder how users might actually use the product-- if they would actually monitor the questions coming in.  I go into more detail in the <a href="#improvements">improvements</a> section at the bottom.  Unfortunately, the focus at this point was only on development, not on more research.</p>

                            <p class="subtitle_description">Innovation is not from a lone genius cooking ideas up in their room</p>
                            <p class="step_description">I think the most important thing I learned from this project is that design must first and foremost be user-centered, rather than aesthetics being first.  Also, I always thought that great inventions and ideas came like a light bulb to inventors, but I found that new inventions are based on research on user data and needs, and ideas are usually built up over time.  This project opened my eyes to see that UX design can change the world in so many different ways, such as connecting students to professors, or changing social issues through research and design.</p>

                            <p class="subtitle_description">Encountering Constraints</p>

                            <p class="step_description">Also, this was my first experience working with a development team.  Product development is really learning to remember to build for the user, but also understanding technical constraints, and trying to find a good compromise.  I encountered many more constraints here, most of which was time.  The UX Design process is great, but there is wisdom in knowing what is needed at what point, and trying to make do with what you have.</p>

                            <p class="subtitle_description">More Testing</p>
                            <p class="step_description">As mentioned before, I wish we could have tested our new ideas and screens with more users ahead of time.  Now, after the first iteration is live, I would love to test our product in the wild, where professors and users would use it in their classrooms.  My guess is that students will also be tempted to just type their question without checking if others had already asked the same question.  I am also worried that students might have a hard time concentrating on the lecture, note-taking, and trying to keep up with all the questions coming in.</p>

                            <p class="subtitle_description">More Research and Questions</p>

                            <p class="step_description">I also wish I had more time to do more research even before redesigning this product. I have so many questions about the product-- even though the focus for the professors are the top questions, what about the students? Do students even want to be looking at the incoming questions during lecture? Would it just be distracting to try to keep up with the questions and the lectures and the note-taking? Or do students only REALLY care about the questions they asked and if they would be answered? If that's the case, should we highlight YOUR questions as a student and their ranking? Also, how can we prevent repeating questions?  Would we potentially create a search of keywords while studetns are typing their question?</p>

                            <p class="subtitle_description">Measuring Success</p>


                            <p class="step_description">The goal of this product is to make it easier for students to ask their questions and to learn, and for teachers to have an easier time answering questions.  I would use 1) any increase in grade averages over time, and 2) less interactions between TAs and students (less emails and less people coming to office hours) if the grade averages stayed the same. The first is difficult to prove that it was the app the showed the significant improvement, which is why it needs to be the only changing variable, and done with a large sample of classes.  With time however, while that will help maintain the same variables (with the same class), improvements could also happen because the professor or TAs improved.</p>
