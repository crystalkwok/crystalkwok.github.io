                        <p>In large universities, such as UCSD, communication is one-way from the professor to the students. Mustaske uses a live chat room to help facilitate in class lectures, where a student can feel safe to ask questions without being judged, and the professor can meet their goals of helping large bodies of students learn. 
                        </p>

                        <p>This project was a combination between two projects-- Flunkless, which focused on user research, and Mustaske, which focused on development.  I personally chose to develop my design skills through multiple iterations.

Our research showed different parties simply tried to communicate with one another, but barriers included fear of judgment and clutter from the important information.  We decided on a product to facilitate better communication and engagement between a large group and a single professor using synchronous communication. This product would not replace lectures, but simply facilitate it for better communication between a large group and a single speaker.</p>

By increasing openness about confusion and questions, professors can have more clarity on meeting the needs of the students.  Live interaction encourages quicker and efficient feedback, since professors wanted to mass communicate easily.

By focusing on interaction (voting, question) only for the students, we increase engagement in the material and give them a sense of ownership and control over their learning, creating changes in priority questions.

However, I thought the IDs were a good choice, considering our constraint.

                            <p class="step_description">I think the most important thing I learned from this project is that design must first and foremost be user-centered, rather than aesthetics being first.  Also, I always thought that great inventions and ideas came like a light bulb to inventors, but I found that new inventions are based on research on user data and needs, and ideas are usually built up over time.  This project opened my eyes to see that UX design can change the world in so many different ways, such as connecting students to professors, or changing social issues through research and design.</p>

                            <p class="step_description">This was my first experience working with a development team.  Product development is remembering to build for the user, but also understanding technical constraints, and trying to find a good compromise.  I encountered many more constraints here, most of which was time.  The UX Design process is great, but there is wisdom in knowing what is needed at what point, and trying to make do with what you have.</p>

Now, after the first iteration is live, I would love to test our product in the wild, where professors and users would use it in their classrooms.  My guess is that students will also be tempted to just type their question without checking if others had already asked the same question.  I'm also worried that students might have a hard time concentrating on the lecture, note-taking, and trying to keep up with all the questions coming in.</p>

                            <p class="subtitle_description">More Research and Questions</p>

                            <p class="step_description">I also wish I had more time to do more research even before redesigning this product. I have so many questions about the product-- even though the focus for the professors are the top questions, what about the students? Do students even want to be looking at the incoming questions during lecture? Would it be distracting to keep up with the questions and the lectures and the note-taking?  Should we highlight that user's question and their ranking, if most students only care about the question they ask? Also, how can we prevent repeating questions?  Would we potentially create a search of keywords while students are typing their question?</p>

                            <p class="step_description">The goal of this product is to make it easier for students to ask their questions and to learn, and for teachers to have an easier time answering questions.  I would use 1) any increase in grade averages over time, and 2) less interactions between TAs and students (less emails and less people coming to office hours) if the grade averages stayed the same. The first is difficult to prove that the app caused the significant improvement, which is why it needs to be the only changing variable, and done with a large sample of classes.  With time, however, even though it will help maintain the same variables (with the same class), improvements could also happen because the professor or TAs improved.</p>
